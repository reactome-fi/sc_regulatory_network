# Build regulatory networks composed of both TFs and Pathways based scRNA-seq
This repo hosts the code to build gene expression regulatory networks based on scRNA-seq data. The networks contain both TFs and pathways from Reactome. The code uses scpy4reactome, which can be installed by following the instruction hosted at https://github.com/reactome-fi/fi_sc_analysis/tree/master/python.
